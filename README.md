# Expaux
## This project is a game-oriented learning experience with Rust and Vulkan.
I have only a little experience with Vulkan, and none with Rust, but I decided to try to learn both at the same time. Yeah, whatever.

## Dependencies:
So far, only vulkano (https://github.com/tomaka/vulkano). Possibly going to integrate specs (https://github.com/slide-rs/specs) in the future, although I usually prefer to write my own ECS.

There's going to be a lot of copied/modified code in here at first. Thanks go to the vulkano guys for the example projects they include. Once I get the hang of everthing, I'll replace it with purely original work, as far as that is possible.
